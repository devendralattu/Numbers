For #coins = 4, we have
$  1 coin on 1st row
$$ 2 coins on 2nd row
$  1 coin on 3rd row

* total = 4 coins
* We need unique number of coins per row.
* Therefore, answer = 2

Execution >>> 

Enter length of array = 
2
Enter coin number 1 = 4
Enter coin number 2 = 6
Max items at 'c'th step => n(n + 1)/2
n^2 + n -8 = 0
2
n^2 + n -12 = 0
3
