For #coins = 4, we have<br>
$  1 coin on 1st row<br>
$$ 2 coins on 2nd row<br>
$  1 coin on 3rd row<br> = total = 4 coins <br>

We need unique number of coins per row.<br>
Therefore, answer = 2<br><br>

Execution >>> 

Enter length of array = 2<br>
Enter coin number 1 = 4<br>
Enter coin number 2 = 6<br><br>
Max items at 'c'th step => n(n + 1)/2<br><br>
n^2 + n -8 = 0<br>
2<br>
n^2 + n -12 = 0<br>
3<br>
