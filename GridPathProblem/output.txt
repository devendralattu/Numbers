# Sample output for 2 rows and 3 columns. Note : S = Source and D = Destination
# You can only move to the right or to the bottom of the grid.
# Goal is to start from S and reach D and count all the unique possible paths.

Enter n = 2
Enter m = 3
Taking n<m. Therefore, n = 2 & m = 3
Grid will look like this before calculating all paths
S 0 0 
0 0 D 

Grid will look like this after calculation of all paths
0 0 0 
1 1 0 

Total number of paths = 3
